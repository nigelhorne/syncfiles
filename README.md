Copy all files in a given directory to a date based hierecachy in a number of places (@targets). The dates of last access and modification are preserved.

For example "sync_files /tmp/foo" will copy all of the files last modified on 22/8/18 in /tmp/foo to /target1/2018/August/22, /target2/2018/August/22 and so on.

I use this to take lots of copies of photographs to many disks for backup, and have them stored by date.
